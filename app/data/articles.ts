    "excerpt": "A $4 hostel in Phnom Penh with generational bedbugs, a seatless toilet, and a 2am durian incident.",
    "body": "<p>Four dollars a night should have been the warning. I knew that. You know that. Everyone with a functioning prefrontal cortex knows that a bed advertised at four US dollars in central Phnom Penh is not a bed you want to sleep in. But I'd just come off a twelve-hour bus from <a href=\"https://www.lonelyplanet.com/cambodia/siem-reap\">Siem Reap</a> where the air conditioning had been broken since roughly 2014, and the tuk-tuk driver who picked me up at the station said he knew a place. \"Very clean, my friend. Very good.\" He said this with the confidence of a man who had never set foot inside.</p>\n    <p>The hostel had one of those names that tries way too hard. Three positive words crammed together, none of which applied. You know the type. I won't name it because I'm not trying to get sued, but just imagine the most aggressively optimistic name possible for a building that should probably be condemned.</p>\n    <p>I should describe the entrance, because \"entrance\" is doing a lot of heavy lifting here. You walked through a doorway that was partially blocked by a motorbike, then past a woman frying something in a wok balanced on a propane tank, then up a staircase so narrow my backpack scraped both walls simultaneously. The reception desk was a plastic chair with a laminated price list taped to it. Nobody was sitting in the chair. I stood there for about six minutes before a guy in boxer shorts wandered out of a room, took my four dollars, handed me a key attached to a wooden spoon, and wandered back without saying a word.</p>\n    <figure class=\"article-image\">\n      <img src=\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1593150760735-aa6a9dae5d80?w=1200&q=80\" alt=\"\">\n      <figcaption>Not the actual entrance. But disturbingly close.</figcaption>\n    </figure>\n    <h3>The Room That Technically Qualified as a Room</h3>\n    <p>Room 7. Top floor, which in this building meant third floor, which in reality meant about two and a half because the ceilings were so low I could press my palms flat against them. The door opened inward and immediately hit the bed frame, so you had to sort of limbo sideways to get in. There was a fan on the ceiling that looked like it hadn't spun since the Clinton administration. I flicked the switch. Nothing. I flicked it again. A grinding noise, like a cat being slowly fed into a pencil sharpener, and then one blade started rotating while the other two stayed still.</p>\n    <p>The mattress had a history. I don't mean that in the interesting way, like \"this mattress has stories to tell.\" I mean it in the forensic way, like someone should be dusting it for prints. It was stained in a pattern that suggested either a very large coffee had been spilled or something significantly worse had happened. The sheet was fitted in the sense that someone had tried to fit it and given up about 60% of the way through, leaving one corner of bare mattress exposed like a wound.</p>\n    <p>I sat on it anyway. I was tired. I was stupid.</p>\n    <h3>A Bathroom That Should Be Reported to The Hague</h3>\n    <p>The bathroom situation requires its own section because it was, and I mean this literally, the worst room I have ever stood in. The shower was a rubber hose duct-taped to the wall at about chest height. The toilet had no seat. Not \"the seat was broken\" but rather it had clearly never had one, like whoever installed it just thought the porcelain rim was fine for human sitting. The floor was permanently wet, not from recent use but from what seemed to be a fundamental architectural disagreement between the pipes and gravity. There was a smell. I won't describe the smell because some things should die with me, but I will say I brushed my teeth in the hallway with bottled water from that point forward.</p>\n    <h3>The 2 AM Durian Incident</h3>\n    <p>And then I met my roommates.</p>\n    <p>The hostel had apparently put me in an eight-bed dorm despite the listing saying \"private room,\" a discrepancy that four-dollar-a-night establishments tend not to worry about. Three of the beds were occupied. Bunk one held a German guy named Klaus who was six foot four and snored like a chainsaw being drowned in a bathtub. Bunk two held a couple from somewhere in Eastern Europe who spent the entire evening arguing in hushed, venomous whispers that occasionally erupted into what sounded like threats. Bunk three was empty when I arrived but was claimed around 2 AM by a man who turned on the overhead fluorescent light, ate an entire durian fruit on his bed, and then fell asleep with the light still on.</p>\n    <div class=\"pullquote\"><p>The durian. In an enclosed room. With no ventilation. I want you to sit with that for a moment.</p></div>\n    <h3>These Bedbugs Had Grandchildren</h3>\n    <p>But the bedbugs were the real stars of the evening. I woke up around 4 AM with my left arm looking like a connect-the-dots puzzle. Little red welts in a neat line running from my wrist to my elbow, because bedbugs are nothing if not methodical. If you've never dealt with these little bastards, <a href=\"https://www.worldnomads.com/travel-safety/worldwide/bugs-bites-stings\">World Nomads has a solid guide</a> on what to look for. I pulled back the sheet and saw them, actual living insects, just hanging out on the mattress like they'd been there longer than I had and frankly had more right to the bed. One of them was so fat and blood-drunk it barely moved when I flicked it. My blood. That was my blood inside that bug.</p>\n    <p>I got up, turned on my phone flashlight, and inspected the bed frame. The wooden slats had clusters of them in the joints, little rust-colored colonies tucked into every crack. This wasn't an infestation that had just started. This was generational. These bedbugs had grandchildren.</p>\n    <p>I spent the rest of the night sitting upright in the plastic chair in the hallway, using my backpack as a pillow and my sarong as a blanket, while stray cats wandered past and a rooster on a nearby rooftop started crowing at 4:45 AM because roosters in Southeast Asia have absolutely no respect for appropriate crowing hours.</p>\n    <figure class=\"article-image\">\n      <img src=\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1513415431480-085b5e5b10fb?w=1200&q=80\" alt=\"\">\n      <figcaption>My 4 AM hallway companion. Better roommate than Klaus.</figcaption>\n    </figure>\n    <h3>Bug Spray for Half the Room Rate</h3>\n    <p>At 6 AM I went downstairs to complain. The same guy in boxer shorts was there, now also wearing a tank top, which I suppose counted as getting dressed for work. I showed him the bites on my arm. I showed him a photo of the bugs on my phone. He looked at both, shrugged, and said \"no refund.\" Then he offered to sell me a can of bug spray for two dollars, which, if you're keeping track, was half the room rate. I declined. He shrugged again. I got the strong sense he'd had this conversation before.</p>\n    <p>I walked out at 6:15 AM, covered in bites, smelling faintly of durian that had permeated my clothes, and booked a guesthouse down the road on <a href=\"https://www.booking.com/city/kh/phnom-penh.html\">Booking.com</a> for eleven dollars a night that had actual sheets and a toilet seat and no visible wildlife. Eleven dollars. That's what separating myself from the bedbugs cost. Less than two pints back home.</p>\n    <h3>The Toilet Seat Revelation</h3>\n    <p>The thing is, I could have just paid the eleven dollars in the first place. I could have read the reviews, which I later checked and which included phrases like \"do not stay here under any circumstances\" and \"I think someone died in my room.\" But budget travel does something to your brain. It rewires you. You start thinking four dollars is a deal instead of a warning. You start believing that discomfort is authenticity, that suffering is what separates real travellers from tourists. You tell yourself you're not the kind of person who needs a toilet seat.</p>\n    <div class=\"pullquote\"><p>You are. Everyone is. That's what toilet seats are for.</p></div>\n    <p>I still have a scar on my left forearm from where I scratched the bites too hard in the heat, a tiny constellation of pale dots that I'll carry with me longer than any souvenir I've ever bought. Some nights, when I'm falling asleep in a perfectly decent bed in a perfectly decent room, I think about that mattress in room 7 and the fat bedbug that wouldn't move, and I feel an itch that isn't really there. Four dollars a night, and I'm still paying for it.</p>\n    \n      <div class=\"score\">0.5<span>/10</span></div>\n      <div class=\"verdict\">Would rather sleep in a tuk-tuk</div>\n    </div>",

    "excerpt": "The La Paz to Uyuni overnight bus. A death-wish driver, broken seats, and a passenger named Roberto. Roberto was a chicken.",
    "body": "<h3>The Ticket Said \"12 Hours.\" The Ticket Lied.</h3>\n    <p>The bus from <a href=\"https://www.lonelyplanet.com/bolivia/la-paz\">La Paz</a> to <a href=\"https://www.lonelyplanet.com/bolivia/uyuni\">Uyuni</a> is supposed to take ten hours. I want you to understand that no human being has ever completed this journey in ten hours. Twelve is optimistic. Fourteen is realistic. Mine took nineteen, and by the end I had aged roughly forty years and developed a personal relationship with a chicken named, as far as I could tell, Roberto.</p>\n    <p>I bought the ticket at the La Paz bus terminal, which is itself a place that could break a person. Forty-odd competing ticket booths, all staffed by people screaming departure times at you like auctioneers having a breakdown. I picked the company with the newest-looking booth, which in retrospect is like choosing your dentist based on their curtains. The ticket cost 120 bolivianos, about twelve bucks. I thought that was a bargain. I was wrong. It was a ransom paid in advance for suffering not yet endured.</p>\n    <figure class=\"article-image\">\n      <img src=\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1662103366766-732fb2423ff5?w=1200&q=80\" alt=\"\">\n      <figcaption>The Altiplano at dawn. Almost worth the spinal damage.</figcaption>\n    </figure>\n    <h3>Boarding at the Hour of Regret</h3>\n    <p>Departure was listed for 8pm. The bus arrived at 9:45. Nobody around me reacted to this, which should have been my first clue that time itself operates differently on Bolivian overnight routes. The bus looked like it had been manufactured during a period of history I'd associate more with the steam engine than modern road transport. It was painted in a colour I'd describe as \"optimistic blue,\" faded to a defeated grey along the panels where the Altiplano winds had sandblasted the paint into memory.</p>\n    <p>I found my seat. Seat 23. The number was there, scratched into the metal frame, but what sat above that number was less a seat and more a suggestion. The recline function consisted of the backrest being permanently broken at a 110-degree angle, which sounds almost comfortable until you realise that the seat in front of you is broken at the same angle, directly into your kneecaps. I am five foot ten. I am not a large man. I was folded like a letter nobody wanted to send.</p>\n    <h3>The Temperature Situation</h3>\n    <p>The Altiplano at night drops to around minus ten. I knew this. I had a jumper, a coat, a scarf. What I did not account for was that the heating system on this bus appeared to work on a binary. It was either off completely, letting the Andean cold creep through the single-pane windows like something that wanted to kill you, or it was blasting what I can only describe as the exhalation of a dying furnace directly onto my ankles at roughly 400 degrees. There was no middle setting. My feet were being slow-roasted while my face developed frostbite. I was simultaneously sweating and shivering, which I didn't think the human body could do until that night proved me comprehensively wrong.</p>\n    <h3>The Driver and His Relationship with Mortality</h3>\n    <p>Somewhere around midnight we began the descent off the plateau and onto the unpaved roads that connect the Altiplano to the salt flats. I use the word \"roads\" with tremendous generosity. These were suggestions of paths, carved into dust and rock, with drops on one side that I couldn't see the bottom of in the dark but could absolutely feel in my stomach every time the driver took a corner at a speed that implied he had made peace with God sometime earlier that evening.</p>\n    <p>He honked constantly. Not at other vehicles, because there were no other vehicles. Just into the void. Into the black Bolivian night. Honking, I think, at the concept of danger itself, as if the horn was a ward against physics. Every ten or fifteen minutes the bus would hit a pothole so deep that the entire vehicle would leave the ground for a moment, and forty-odd passengers would levitate briefly in their broken seats before crashing back down in a chorus of groans and swearing in three languages.</p>\n    <div class=\"pullquote\"><p>The woman next to me slept through all of this. I still think about her. What had she survived in her life that this bus was restful by comparison?</p></div>\n    <h3>Roberto and the 3am Stop</h3>\n    <p>At roughly 3am the bus stopped in what appeared to be nowhere. Not a town. Not a village. A building, alone, made of concrete blocks, with a single fluorescent tube buzzing above a door. Everyone got off. I got off. Inside was a woman selling soup and bread for 10 bolivianos, and the soup was genuinely one of the best things I have ever eaten in my life, which tells you either that the soup was extraordinary or that suffering is the greatest seasoning known to humanity. Probably both.</p>\n    <p>It was during this stop that Roberto the chicken made his entrance. A man boarding at this middle-of-nowhere waypoint carried a woven bag that moved. He sat two rows ahead of me and placed the bag on the floor, where it continued to move and occasionally cluck. Nobody said anything. The driver glanced at the bag and nodded, like a bouncer approving someone's outfit. Roberto spent the remaining hours of the journey providing a low, persistent soundtrack of displeasure that honestly mirrored my own internal state so perfectly I began to feel a bond with him.</p>\n    <figure class=\"article-image\">\n      <img src=\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1571422657383-e21eeff747c2?w=1200&q=80\" alt=\"\">\n      <figcaption>The salt flats at dawn. Four minutes of beauty. Then another pothole.</figcaption>\n    </figure>\n    <h3>Dawn, Dust, and the Concept of Arrival</h3>\n    <p>The sun came up over the Altiplano at around 6:30, and I will grudgingly admit it was one of the most spectacular things I've ever seen. Pink and orange light spilling across an endless flat white landscape, the <a href=\"https://www.lonelyplanet.com/bolivia/the-southwest/salar-de-uyuni\">salt crust</a> glowing like the surface of another planet. My back was destroyed. My neck had fused into a single angry knot. I hadn't slept. But for about four minutes, looking out that scratched, filthy window, I forgot all of it.</p>\n    <p>Then we hit another pothole and my head bounced off the glass and the moment was over.</p>\n    <p>We pulled into Uyuni at 3pm the following day. Nineteen hours. The town itself is a dusty, wind-blasted grid of concrete buildings that exists purely as a staging point for salt flat tours, and arriving there felt less like reaching a destination and more like being released from captivity. I stepped off the bus on legs that had forgotten their purpose. Roberto's owner walked past me carrying the woven bag, still clucking, and I swear the chicken looked more rested than I did.</p>\n    <p>I found a hostel. 40 bolivianos for a bed. The mattress was a foam pad roughly two inches thick laid on plywood. It was, without exaggeration, the most comfortable thing I had ever felt. I slept for eleven hours. I dreamt of nothing, which was the greatest luxury Bolivia had offered me so far.</p>\n    <h3>Would I Do It Again</h3>\n    <p>People ask me this and I always say no, absolutely not, never. But there's a version of the truth I don't usually share, which is that some part of me, some broken and probably masochistic part, is glad I did it. Not because it was fun. It was categorically not fun. But because every comfortable journey I've taken since then has felt like an unearned gift. I sat on a <a href=\"https://www.thetrainline.com/\">train from London to Edinburgh</a> last year, smooth rails, a table, a plug socket, a man selling coffee from a cart, and I nearly cried with gratitude. That bus from La Paz broke something in me, and whatever it broke needed breaking.</p>\n    <div class=\"pullquote\"><p>Roberto, wherever you are, I hope you're free.</p></div>\n    \n      <div class=\"score\">1<span>/10</span></div>\n      <div class=\"verdict\">One point for Roberto.

    "body": "<p>I'd been in Marrakech for exactly eleven hours before my intestines declared war on the rest of my body. Eleven hours. That's not even enough time to get jet lag sorted, but apparently it's plenty of time to ingest something that would rearrange my entire digestive system for the better part of a week.</p>\n    <p>Let me set the scene without setting the scene. It's <a href=\"https://www.lonelyplanet.com/morocco/marrakesh/attractions/djemaa-el-fna/a/poi-sig/387147/357021\">Jemaa el-Fnaa</a> at around nine in the evening, the smoke from about forty different grills is hanging in the air like fog, and I'm standing in front of a stall watching a man ladle something that looks and smells like the best thing I've ever encountered. Lamb tagine with preserved lemon and olives. Thick, glistening, the kind of thing food photographers dream about. 30 dirhams. About two bucks fifty. I handed over the money like I was doing the smartest thing anyone had ever done.</p>\n    <p>Reader, it was not the smartest thing anyone had ever done.</p>\n    <figure class=\"article-image\">\n      <img src=\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1674227639263-178e4bb52360?w=1200&q=80\" alt=\"\">\n      <figcaption>Jemaa el-Fnaa. Looks magical. Tastes magical. Consequences: less magical.</figcaption>\n    </figure>\n    <h3>The Golden Hours (Before Everything Went Wrong)</h3>\n    <p>I'll give that tagine this much. For about four hours, it was genuinely one of the best meals I'd eaten in months. The lamb fell apart on the fork. The sauce had that deep, slow-cooked warmth that you can taste in your chest. I walked back to my riad in the Mellah feeling like a man who had cracked the code of budget travel. Incredible food, pennies on the pound, stars overhead, the sound of the medina settling into its nighttime hum all around me.</p>\n    <p>I even texted my mate Dave. \"You absolute mug sitting in the pub back home. I'm living the dream out here.\"</p>\n    <p>Dave would have the last laugh. Dave always has the last laugh.</p>\n    <h3>2:47 AM, or, The Reckoning</h3>\n    <p>I woke up and something was deeply, fundamentally wrong. You know that feeling where your stomach makes a noise that sounds less like digestion and more like a radiator about to explode? That. My entire midsection was doing something I can only describe as hostile negotiations with reality. I lay there for maybe thirty seconds telling myself it was fine, just a bit of indigestion, travel belly, nothing serious.</p>\n    <p>Then I moved.</p>\n    <p>Moving was a mistake. Moving activated whatever biological countdown had been silently ticking away, and suddenly I was sprinting across a dark room, crashing into a suitcase, bouncing off a wall, and arriving at a toilet that I would not leave for the next ninety minutes. I will spare you the forensic details but I will say this. I didn't know the human body could do that from both ends simultaneously. I genuinely thought that was a myth, something people exaggerated for comedic effect. It is not a myth. It is violently, humiliatingly real, and it is not comedic when you are the one experiencing it on a toilet in a 400-year-old riad at three in the morning while a cat screams on the roof.</p>\n    <h3>The Bathroom Situation (A Horror Story in Its Own Right)</h3>\n    <p>Now. The riad was beautiful. Hand-carved plaster, zellige tiles everywhere, a little courtyard with orange trees and a fountain. Gorgeous. What it was not was built for a six-foot man who needed to be within lunging distance of a bathroom at all times. My room was on the second floor. The nearest toilet was across the courtyard and up three steps. Three steps that might as well have been Everest when your body has decided that gravity is now your enemy.</p>\n    <p>The toilet itself was the traditional kind. A hole in the floor with foot plates. On a normal day, fine, no problem, when in Rome and all that. But when you're shaking and sweating and your legs have turned to something with the structural integrity of overcooked spaghetti, squatting over a hole in the floor becomes an athletic event you have not trained for. I pulled a muscle in my left thigh. During food poisoning. On a toilet. Try explaining that one to a physiotherapist back home.</p>\n    <div class=\"pullquote\"><p>I pulled a muscle in my left thigh. During food poisoning. On a toilet. Try explaining that one to a physiotherapist back home.</p></div>\n    <h3>Local Remedies, or, How to Make a Bad Situation Worse</h3>\n    <p>By morning I was a ghost. The lovely woman who ran the riad took one look at me and started shaking her head in a way that suggested she'd seen this exact scene play out a hundred times before. She disappeared into the kitchen and came back with a glass of something that looked like muddy water and smelled like a garden centre had burned down.</p>\n    <p>\"Cumin and lemon,\" she said. \"Drink.\"</p>\n    <p>I drank. It tasted exactly how you'd expect cumin dissolved in warm lemon water to taste, which is to say like punishment. She also gave me a handful of dried mint leaves and told me to chew them. I chewed them. I felt nothing except minty and still extremely ill.</p>\n    <p>A taxi driver I stumbled past later that day, during a brave but ultimately foolish attempt to find a pharmacy, told me to drink Coca-Cola that had been left open overnight so the fizz went flat. When I pointed out that I didn't have Coca-Cola or the ability to wait overnight, he shrugged and said \"Inshallah.\" Which is fair enough, really.</p>\n    <p>The pharmacy, when I finally found it in a side street off Avenue Mohammed V, sold me a box of something called Ercefuryl and a packet of <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Dripdrop-ORS-Electrolyte-Powder/dp/B07VKFMGV6\">oral rehydration salts</a> that tasted like drinking the ocean if the ocean were also somehow chalky. The pharmacist held up two fingers. Two days, he said. Two days and I'd be fine. He was right, almost to the hour, which made me wonder just how often he has this exact conversation.</p>\n    <figure class=\"article-image\">\n      <img src=\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1633937255875-1ca9014d29c7?w=1200&q=80\" alt=\"\">\n      <figcaption>Moroccan mint tea. The one thing that didn't try to kill me.</figcaption>\n    </figure>\n    <h3>The Regret Inventory</h3>\n    <p>During the worst of it, lying on my bed with a wet flannel on my forehead like a Victorian consumptive, I conducted a thorough inventory of my life choices. The tagine was the obvious villain, but was it really? I'd also eaten a mystery meat sandwich from a cart near Bab Doukkala around lunchtime. And some olives from a massive open-air barrel that roughly ten thousand flies had been treating as a swimming pool. And I'd definitely had a glass of orange juice from one of the stalls in the square, the ones where they squeeze the oranges right in front of you, which feels reassuring until you notice the glasses are being \"washed\" in a bucket of water that hasn't been changed since the Almoravid dynasty.</p>\n    <p>Could have been any of them. Could have been all of them working in concert like some kind of bacterial orchestra, each playing their own instrument of destruction. (If you think this is bad, read about <a class=\"internal\" href=\"#\" onclick=\"showPage('delhi');return false\">the lassi in Varanasi</a> that nearly finished me off.)</p>\n    <h3>Day Three, or, The Fragile Peace</h3>\n    <p>By Wednesday I could eat plain bread without my stomach making threats. By Thursday I managed half a bowl of harira soup and felt like I'd climbed a mountain. By Friday I was back in the medina, walking past the food stalls in Jemaa el-Fnaa, and here's the thing that nobody tells you about food poisoning abroad. You go right back. You walk past the exact same kind of stall, and the smoke hits you, and the smell of cumin and charcoal and saffron fills your head, and some part of your brain that clearly wasn't paying attention during the trauma goes \"that looks nice actually.\"</p>\n    <p>I didn't eat the tagine again. I'm not completely stupid. I had a chicken bastilla from a different stall instead, all flaky pastry and cinnamon and icing sugar, and it was perfect, and nothing bad happened, and I walked back to the riad feeling like maybe the whole thing had been worth it after all.</p>\n    <p>It wasn't worth it. I lost four pounds and a muscle in my thigh. But the bastilla was genuinely excellent.</p>\n    \n      <div class=\"score\">2<span>/10</span></div>\n      <div class=\"verdict\">Two points for the bastilla.

Every alley curves. Every turn looks the same. The smell of cedar and raw leather drifts from seventeen directions at once, and the ground beneath your shoes shifts between cobblestone, packed dirt, and what I really hope was just mud.</p>\n    <p>So when a guy around my age fell into step beside me and said \"Tanneries? I'm going that way, my friend,\" I thought, great. Convenient. He wasn't pushy about it. Didn't grab my arm or anything. Just walked alongside me chatting about football, asking where I was from, telling me his cousin lived in Manchester. Classic stuff. I knew the playbook. I'd read the blogs. I was aware, on an intellectual level, that friendly strangers in tourist zones are usually working an angle.</p>\n    <div class=\"pullquote\"><p>But he was so genuinely likeable. That's the thing nobody warns you about properly. They're warm and funny and they make you feel like a bit of a racist for being suspicious.</p></div>\n    <p>So I followed him.</p>\n    <figure class=\"article-image\">\n      <img src=\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1567096209893-8dac63a53661?w=1200&q=80\" alt=\"\">\n      <figcaption>The tanneries. Genuinely spectacular. Spectacularly expensive to see, as it turns out.</figcaption>\n    </figure>\n    <h3>The Scenic Route Through Someone's Living Room</h3>\n    <p>We took a turn I would never have found on my own, through a doorway so narrow I had to angle my shoulders, down a passage that smelled like mint tea and donkey, and suddenly we were on a rooftop overlooking the tannery pits. The famous ones. Hundreds of stone vats filled with dye in every colour, workers knee-deep in white liquid that I later learned was pigeon droppings mixed with quicklime. The whole thing hit my nose like a wall of hot garbage wrapped in ammonia. Someone pressed a sprig of fresh mint into my hand. I held it to my face and breathed through it like a gas mask while my eyes watered.</p>\n    <p>And the view was genuinely spectacular. I'll give them that. The leather pits of Marrakech look like a giant paint palette left out in the sun, these perfect circles of saffron yellow and poppy red and deep indigo, with tiny figures moving between them. Worth seeing. No question.</p>\n    <p>The problem was everything that happened next.</p>\n    <h3>Would You Like to See Where the Magic Happens</h3>\n    <p>My new best friend handed me off to another guy who worked in the leather shop attached to the terrace. Seamless transition. Like a relay race, except I was the baton and also the prize money. This second bloke gave me a tour of the workshop downstairs, showed me how they soften the hides, how they cut the leather, how they stitch the bags. He put a jacket on me. Then a different jacket. Then he started pulling bags off shelves and opening them in front of me while saying things like \"feel that, feel the quality\" and \"for you, special price.\"</p>\n    <p>I didn't want a leather bag. I don't even carry a bag. I'm the kind of person who shoves their passport in their back pocket and calls it packing. But I was standing in this man's workshop, wearing his jacket, surrounded by his colleagues, and the social pressure was extraordinary. It was like being at a dinner party where the host cooked something terrible and everyone's pretending it's delicious. You just go along with it because the alternative is confrontation, and you're Australian, so you'd rather just cop it than cause a scene.</p>\n    <p>I bought a wallet for 350 dirham. About thirty-five bucks. The leather was decent, I'll admit. But I already had a wallet. I now owned two wallets, which is exactly zero wallets more than any person needs, and the guy who \"happened to be walking my way\" was waiting outside for his commission.</p>\n    <h3>But Wait, There's a Monkey</h3>\n    <p>Emboldened by having only been mildly ripped off, I wandered back to Jemaa el-Fnaa feeling like I'd handled things pretty well, actually. Thirty-five bucks for a wallet and a rooftop view of the tanneries. Cultural experience. Not bad. I was feeling good about myself, which is always the moment before disaster.</p>\n    <p>A man with a Barbary macaque on a chain made eye contact with me. I smiled. Never smile at a man with a monkey. That should be in every guidebook, printed in red, underlined. The monkey was on my shoulder before I could process what was happening. Another monkey appeared on my other shoulder. A third was placed in my hands. Someone put a snake around my neck. I was suddenly a human Christmas tree decorated exclusively with animals, and three guys were taking photos on MY phone, which one of them had gently removed from my hand.</p>\n    <p>Then they wanted 200 dirham per animal. Plus the snake.</p>\n    <p>I negotiated down to 100 dirham total, which felt like a victory at the time but was absolutely not a victory. I paid ten bucks to hold animals I didn't ask to hold while strangers took photos on my own phone that I could have taken myself if I'd had any control over the situation whatsoever.</p>\n    <figure class=\"article-image\">\n      <img src=\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1570168007204-dfb528c6958f?w=1200&q=80\" alt=\"\">\n      <figcaption>Marrakech at sunset. Beautiful. Expensive. Worth it? Ask my wallet. Both of them.</figcaption>\n    </figure>\n    <h3>The Moment of Clarity in a Mint Tea Shop</h3>\n    <p>I sat down at a cafe on a side street afterward, ordered a pot of mint tea for 15 dirham, and did the maths on my afternoon. The wallet. The monkeys. The snake surcharge. The tip I gave my \"friend\" because I felt guilty. I was down about \u20ac55, and I'd been in the city less than a full day. At this rate I'd be bankrupt by Thursday.</p>\n    <p>The tea was perfect, though. Poured from a height into a small glass, searingly hot, sweet enough to make my teeth ache. The cafe had blue tile walls and a ceiling fan that wobbled with every rotation like it was about to launch itself into orbit. An old man at the next table was playing a card game I didn't recognise with two friends, slapping cards down with tremendous force and arguing about every hand.</p>\n    <p>I sat there for an hour, watching the light change on the alley walls from bright gold to deep orange, and I thought about what an absolute muppet I'd been. The thing is, I knew. I knew every step of the way that I was being played. The friendly guide, the rooftop, the leather shop, the incremental commitment. I'd read about all of it. I just thought it wouldn't work on me, because I thought I was clever, which is exactly the kind of person it works on best.</p>\n    <h3>Lessons I Definitely Won't Remember Next Time</h3>\n    <p>The wallet fell apart within three months. The stitching came undone first, then the dye started transferring onto everything it touched, and eventually the whole thing sort of dissolved like it was made of compressed tea leaves. I kept it anyway, stuffed in a drawer somewhere, because throwing it away would mean admitting the full extent of my stupidity out loud, and I wasn't ready for that conversation with myself.</p>\n    <p>I went back to Marrakech two years later and <a class=\"internal\" href=\"#\" onclick=\"showPage('food');return false\">got food poisoning</a> AND got scammed again. Different scam, same neighbourhood. A guy told me the main square was closed for a \"special ceremony\" and offered to show me a different route, which ended at his brother's spice shop. I bought cumin.</p>\n    <p>I already had cumin at home.</p>\n    \n      <div class=\"score\">3<span>/10</span></div>\n      <div class=\"verdict\">Three points because the tanneries were actually sick.

    "body": "<h3>The Audacity of Neon</h3>\n    <p>I turned thirty last month. I mention this because it's relevant to the story, and also because I'm still processing it. Thirty years old, standing in the lobby of a Bangkok party hostel at 11pm on a Tuesday, watching a shirtless Australian do a backflip into a pool the size of a bathtub. I had booked this place because it was twelve bucks a night and had free wifi. I did not read the reviews carefully enough.</p>\n    <p>The neon lights were the first sign. Not tasteful accent lighting. Not a subtle glow. I'm talking full Vegas strip, mounted directly above the bunk beds, pulsing in a pattern that suggested the owner had once been to a rave in 2007 and never emotionally recovered. Purple, then pink, then blue, then a seizure-inducing white flash, then back to purple. All night. Every night. The switch, I was told by a staff member who found my question genuinely confusing, did not exist.</p>\n    <p>\"It's the vibe, bro.\"</p>\n    <p>Right. The vibe.</p>\n    <h3>3am and the Pool Has Opinions</h3>\n    <p>I want to be clear that I have nothing against fun. I've had fun before. I distinctly remember having fun in 2019. But there is something profoundly disorienting about being woken at 3am by the collective scream of forty people doing a cannonball competition while someone's bluetooth speaker blasts \"Mr. Brightside\" for what I can only assume was the ninth consecutive time that evening. The walls of my dorm room were approximately the thickness of a digestive biscuit, so the pool area might as well have been inside my bunk.</p>\n    <p>I lay there in my sleeping bag liner, eye mask pushed up on my forehead because the neon rendered it useless, and genuinely contemplated my life choices. I have a pension. I own a cheese grater. I once spent a Saturday afternoon comparing energy tariffs. And here I was, trying to sleep three feet away from a twenty-one year old named something like Brayden who had hung his soaking wet board shorts on my bed frame and was now asking the room if anyone wanted to \"smash some buckets on <a href=\"https://www.lonelyplanet.com/thailand/bangkok/attractions/th-khao-san/a/poi-sig/387667/357046\">Khao San</a>.\"</p>\n    <h3>Backpacking Is Not a Personality, Tyler</h3>\n    <p>The common area was where hope went to die. Every evening around seven, the same cast of characters would assemble on beanbags that smelled faintly of spilled Chang and sunscreen. There was always someone with a guitar who knew three chords and wasn't afraid to use them. There was always a couple who had been travelling for eleven months and wanted you to know about it. There was always a bloke called something like Tyler or Josh who would corner you by the water cooler and explain, unprompted, that travel had really changed him as a person.</p>\n    <p>\"You just see the world differently after Southeast Asia, you know?\"</p>\n    <p>Tyler had been in Southeast Asia for six weeks. He had seen the inside of approximately forty bars and one temple, and he'd only gone to the temple because a girl he fancied suggested it. But sure, Tyler. You're basically the Dalai Lama now.</p>\n    <p>The worst part is that I used to be Tyler. Maybe not Tyler exactly, but a version of him. Twenty-two, armed with a backpack the size of a small child and the unshakeable belief that ordering pad thai from a street cart made me culturally enlightened. The difference is that at twenty-two, sleeping in a room with eleven strangers felt like an adventure. At thirty, it feels like a punishment handed down by a very specific and cruel god.</p>\n    <div class=\"pullquote\"><p>I have a pension. I own a cheese grater. I once spent a Saturday afternoon comparing energy tariffs.</p></div>\n    <h3>The Bluetooth Speaker Accords</h3>\n    <p>I need to talk about the bluetooth speaker. Every hostel dorm has one. It belongs to no one and everyone simultaneously. It lives on a shelf or a windowsill, and it plays a rotating playlist of songs that were popular two summers ago at a medium-effort music festival. No one controls it. No one takes responsibility for it. It simply exists, like gravity or the common cold, and you must accept its presence in your life.</p>\n    <p>At this particular hostel, the speaker lived on the shelf above my head. It played \"Blinding Lights\" by The Weeknd at least four times per night. I know this because I was awake for all of them, staring at the underside of the bunk above me, watching the neon lights cycle through their demonic rotation, wondering if this is what purgatory sounds like.</p>\n    <p>On my third night I asked, very politely, if someone could turn it off after midnight. The room looked at me the way you'd look at someone who had just asked you to stop breathing. A girl in the bottom bunk opposite actually said \"that's kind of the point of a party hostel\" with the gentle condescension usually reserved for explaining things to very small children or very old dogs.</p>\n    <h3>Checkout Was Spiritual</h3>\n    <p>I lasted four nights. Not because I'm tough, but because I'd prepaid and the cancellation policy was written in a font size that suggested they knew exactly what they were doing. On the morning I left, I dragged my bag through the common area at 6am, stepping over two people asleep on beanbags and one person who appeared to be meditating but was actually just sitting very still with his eyes closed because he'd lost his room key.</p>\n    <p>The taxi driver asked me where I was going. I gave him the name of a hotel. A proper hotel, found on <a href=\"https://www.hostelworld.com/st/hostels/asia/thailand/bangkok/\">Hostelworld</a> this time with actual reviews read in full, with walls and a door that locked and lights with switches. It cost four times as much and it was worth every single baht. I slept for fourteen hours straight in a room so quiet I could hear my own heartbeat, and I thought about Tyler, and Brayden, and the bluetooth speaker, and I felt something I can only describe as overwhelming, bone-deep gratitude that I would never be twenty-two again.</p>\n    \n      <div class=\"score\">1.5<span>/10</span></div>\n      <div class=\"verdict\">Half a point per night I survived.

    "body": "<h3>The Airport That Technically Exists Near a City</h3>\n    <p>I paid fourteen euros for a flight across Europe. Fourteen euros. And I want every single cent back.</p>\n    <p>It started at 2:15 in the morning, because my flight was at 5:40 from an airport that calls itself by the name of a major European capital but sits a solid 90 minutes outside it by bus. The bus, naturally, cost more than the flight. I stood at a suburban petrol station in the dark, surrounded by other dead-eyed budget travelers clutching printed boarding passes like lottery tickets nobody won, waiting for a coach that smelled like it had recently transported livestock. We arrived at a building that resembled a large Lidl with a runway behind it. Two check-in desks were open. Three hundred people were in the queue.</p>\n    <h3>You Want Luggage? That'll Be Extra</h3>\n    <p>Booking the ticket had been its own special adventure. The base fare was fourteen euros but I genuinely believe they employ a team of psychologists to design the checkout process. Do you want a carry-on bag? Twelve euros. A checked bag? Twenty-eight euros. A seat assignment so you're not wedged between a stag party and a crying infant? Seven euros. <a href=\"https://www.worldnomads.com/\">Travel insurance</a> you'll never use? Automatically opted in. Priority boarding, which just means you get to stand in a slightly different queue? Another six euros. By the time I'd unticked every box and declined every upsell, I'd been on the website for forty minutes and my blood pressure had risen measurably.</p>\n    <p>I chose to travel with just a backpack stuffed under the seat in front of me. The backpack had to fit inside a little metal cage at the gate, and I watched a woman in front of me sit on her bag trying to compress it while a gate agent looked on with the enthusiasm of a parking warden.</p>\n    <h3>Seats Designed by Someone Who Hates the Human Spine</h3>\n    <p>The plane itself was a masterpiece of hostile architecture. The seats were upholstered in a shade of blue that doesn't occur in nature, a blue that says \"we bought 40,000 metres of this fabric because it was cheap.\" They did not recline. Not even slightly. The tray table came down at an angle that made it useful only as a slide for your drink to travel directly into your lap. Legroom was theoretical. My kneecaps were pressed into the seat pocket in front of me, which contained a laminated safety card, a catalogue selling inflatable neck pillows for twenty-two euros, and the crumbs of whoever flew last.</p>\n    <p>The overhead lighting was the fluorescent kind they use in police interrogation rooms. It buzzed.</p>\n    <h3>The Kebab Incident</h3>\n    <p>The man next to me boarded carrying a full doner kebab. Not a wrap. Not a sad little flatbread. A proper, open-topped, tinfoil-wrapped monument to garlic sauce and shaved lamb, roughly the size of a newborn. He sat down, placed it on his tray table, and began eating it with the quiet concentration of a surgeon.</p>\n    <p>The smell hit me in waves. First the onions. Then the chilli sauce. Then something deeper and more primal, a warm meat fog that filled our entire row and drifted backward into rows 22 through 25. The woman across the aisle put her scarf over her nose. I sat there, breathing through my mouth, watching tiny flakes of lettuce drift onto his jeans with each bite. He offered me some. I said no. He seemed offended. We didn't speak for the remaining two hours and fifteen minutes.</p>\n    <div class=\"pullquote\"><p>A proper, open-topped, tinfoil-wrapped monument to garlic sauce and shaved lamb, roughly the size of a newborn.</p></div>\n    <h3>Refreshments From the Trolley of Despair</h3>\n    <p>The in-flight menu was a laminated card of horrors. A ham and cheese toastie for six euros fifty. A Pringles tube for four euros. Tap water, and I checked this twice because I thought I was hallucinating, for three euros. The coffee came in a cup the size of a thimble and tasted like it had been filtered through a gym sock. I bought it anyway because I'd been awake since 2am and my will to resist had crumbled somewhere over the Alps.</p>\n    <p>They also sold scratch cards. On a plane. The cabin crew walked the aisle hawking them like they were working a pub on a Friday night. \"Big prizes to be won,\" the announcement said, with absolutely no conviction.</p>\n    <h3>The Landing, and the Applause</h3>\n    <p>We descended through cloud cover with the gentle grace of a shopping trolley rolling down a hill. The landing was firm. I'm being diplomatic. The landing was the kind of impact that makes you check whether your fillings are still in place. The wheels hit tarmac, everyone lurched forward against their non-reclining seats, and the overhead bins made a noise that suggested at least one suitcase had achieved sentience and was trying to escape.</p>\n    <p>And then, beautifully, impossibly, the cabin erupted into applause.</p>\n    <p>Thirty rows of people clapping because the plane had successfully done the one thing it was supposed to do. Land. On the ground. Where the airport is. I looked around to see if anyone else found this absurd but they were all clapping too, genuinely grateful to be alive, and honestly after that landing I understood the impulse.</p>\n    <h3>Was It Worth It?</h3>\n    <p>I collected my backpack from under the seat, shuffled down the aisle past the ghost of the kebab smell still lingering in row 19, and walked out onto a jet bridge that led to another airport named after a city it was nowhere near. The bus into town would be eleven euros. I stood at the stop, sleep-deprived, faintly smelling of garlic sauce that wasn't mine, and did the maths. The total door-to-door cost of this \"fourteen euro flight\" had come to just under seventy euros. For seventy euros I could have taken a train, slept in a proper seat, arrived in the actual city centre, and never once been offered a scratch card at altitude.</p>\n    <p>But I didn't take the train. I never take the train. Because the fare page always shows that fourteen euro number first, glowing on my screen like a little trap, and every single time I walk right into it, convinced that this time will be different. It never is. The kebab smell follows you home.</p>\n    \n      <div class=\"score\">2<span>/10</span></div>\n      <div class=\"verdict\">One point for landing.

    "body": "<h3>Three Days of Invincibility</h3>\n    <p>I want you to understand something about the mindset I was in. Three full days of eating street food in India and not a single rumble. Samosas from a guy whose cart had one working wheel. Pani puri from a stall where the water looked like it had feelings. Chicken tikka from a place with no walls, just a roof and a prayer. Nothing. My stomach was a fortress. I started to believe I was built different.</p>\n    <p>I said that out loud to another traveller at the guesthouse. \"I think I'm just built different.\" She looked at me the way a doctor looks at someone who says they don't need a seatbelt because they've never been in a crash.</p>\n    <h3>The Lassi That Changed Everything</h3>\n    <p>It was a mango lassi. One of those thick, sweet ones served in a clay cup near the <a href=\"https://www.lonelyplanet.com/india/varanasi-benares/attractions/ghats/a/poi-sig/1426788/357589\">ghats in Varanasi</a>, where the smoke from the cremation pyres drifts across the river and everything feels ancient and a little bit unhinged. I bought it because I was hot and cocky and it cost about 30 rupees, which is basically nothing, and I thought well, what's the worst that could happen.</p>\n    <p>The worst that could happen, it turns out, is quite bad.</p>\n    <p>It took about six hours. I was lying on my bed reading when my stomach made a noise I'd never heard a human body produce. Not a gurgle. More like a warning shot from a civil war happening inside my intestines. I put my book down. I sat very still. And then I moved faster than I have ever moved in my life.</p>\n    <h3>The Bathroom and I Became Very Close</h3>\n    <p>The bathroom in this guesthouse was roughly the size of a wardrobe. The shower, the toilet, and the sink were all basically the same piece of furniture. The floor was permanently wet. The light flickered like a horror film. And for the next 48 hours, this was my entire world.</p>\n    <p>I will spare you the graphic details because I have some dignity left, but I will say this. There comes a point in food poisoning where your body runs out of things to expel and just starts doing it recreationally. You lie on the bathroom floor tiles because they're cool against your face and you think about every decision that led you to this moment. The gap year. The flight to Delhi. The confidence. The lassi.</p>\n    <p>That bloody lassi.</p>\n    <div class=\"pullquote\"><p>There comes a point in food poisoning where your body runs out of things to expel and just starts doing it recreationally.</p></div>\n    <h3>The World's Kindest Man and His Useless Chai</h3>\n    <p>The guesthouse owner figured out what was happening pretty quickly, probably because I was groaning loud enough to be heard through the walls. He knocked on my door with a cup of chai and a look of genuine fatherly concern that almost made me cry. He kept saying something in Hindi that I couldn't understand but the tone was unmistakably \"you poor, stupid foreigner.\"</p>\n    <p>He brought me chai four separate times over those two days. I couldn't drink any of it. The smell alone sent me scrambling back to the bathroom. But he kept bringing it, and honestly that might be the purest act of kindness anyone has ever shown me. By cup number three he was also bringing plain rice and looking at me the way you'd look at a dog who ate something it found in a bin.</p>\n    <h3>The Pharmacy Trip From Hell</h3>\n    <p>On day two I decided I needed medicine because I was fairly sure I was dying. I put on clothes for the first time in 36 hours, which felt like climbing Everest, and walked to a pharmacy about 200 metres away. It took me fifteen minutes. I had to stop twice.</p>\n    <p>At the pharmacy I encountered a problem I hadn't anticipated. How do you explain explosive food poisoning to a pharmacist who speaks limited English when you're also trying to maintain some shred of dignity? I started with \"stomach problem\" and pointed at my gut. He nodded and offered me antacids. No mate. Bigger than that. Much bigger.</p>\n    <p>I tried miming. I am not proud of this. I made gestures that no human being should ever have to make in a public place. A woman waiting behind me left the shop. The pharmacist's expression shifted from confusion to horror to understanding, and he handed me a box of tablets and some oral rehydration salts with the efficiency of a man who has seen this exact performance from a hundred sweaty backpackers before me.</p>\n    <p>40 rupees. The cost of my salvation.</p>\n    <h3>Lessons I Definitely Won't Learn</h3>\n    <p>By day three I was functional again, in the way that a car with a flat tyre is technically still a car. I could sit upright. I could eat plain rice without my body staging a protest. I looked at myself in that tiny bathroom mirror, five pounds lighter and roughly the colour of old porridge, and I felt something close to gratitude just for being vertical.</p>\n    <p>People always ask if it put me off street food. Of course it didn't. Two days later I was eating chaat from a roadside stall in the next town, telling myself it was fine, this vendor looked clean, the oil was hot enough to kill anything. The same delusion, rebuilt from scratch, because apparently I am incapable of learning from my own suffering. The guesthouse owner would have been so disappointed in me. He'd probably still have brought the chai though.</p>\n    \n      <div class=\"score\">1<span>/10</span></div>\n      <div class=\"verdict\">One point for the guesthouse owner.

I've watched them tick away on other people's rides through the window of whatever trattoria I'm stuffing my face in. They work perfectly fine. They just happen to break, with astonishing regularity, the exact moment a sweaty tourist with a rolling suitcase and a boarding pass folded into his back pocket climbs into the back seat.</p>\n    <p>My guy didn't even try to be subtle about it. He tapped the meter twice, shrugged like a disappointed father, and said \"Is broken.\" Not \"it's broken\" or \"I'm sorry, sir, the meter appears to be malfunctioning.\" Just \"is broken.\" Two words. The international shorthand for \"you're about to pay whatever number I feel like inventing.\"</p>\n    <p>I knew. I absolutely knew. But my flight home was in two and a half hours and I was standing outside Roma Termini with a suitcase that had a busted wheel, a phone on four percent battery, and the kind of sunburn that makes strangers wince at you. I was not in a negotiating position.</p>\n    <h3>The Grand Tour I Never Asked For</h3>\n    <p>Fiumicino airport is roughly 30 kilometers from central Rome. Thirty. That's a straight shot down the autostrada, maybe 40 minutes with traffic. I know this because I looked it up on the bus ride into the city three days earlier, when I was still an optimist who believed in fixed-rate airport transfers.</p>\n    <p>We did not take the autostrada.</p>\n    <p>We took what I can only describe as the director's cut of Rome. Side streets I'd never heard of. A residential neighbourhood where someone's nonna was hanging laundry from a third-floor balcony. At one point I'm fairly sure we passed the same petrol station twice, though I can't prove it because my phone had died somewhere around the fifteen-minute mark. The driver was chatting away on his own phone the entire time, gesturing with one hand while the other rested on the wheel with the casual confidence of a man who does this eight times a day. Which, to be fair, he probably does.</p>\n    <p>I sat in the back watching the meter that wasn't there not ticking, feeling the euros evaporate from my wallet like sweat off my forehead. The leather seat squeaked every time we went around a corner, which was constantly, because we were apparently taking the scenic route through every corner in Lazio.</p>\n    <div class=\"pullquote\"><p>\"Is broken.\" Two words. The international shorthand for \"you're about to pay whatever number I feel like inventing.\"</p></div>\n    <h3>The Audacity of the Final Number</h3>\n    <p>When we finally pulled up to departures, he turned around with the energy of a waiter presenting the bill at a restaurant where you didn't check the prices. He said a number. I won't repeat it here because my therapist says I need to stop reliving the moment, but I will say this. For the same amount of money I could have eaten a three-course lunch at Roscioli, including wine. Good wine. The kind they keep behind the counter.</p>\n    <p>I paid it. Of course I paid it. What was I going to do, argue? Miss my flight over thirty euros? Stand on the kerb at Fiumicino having a diplomatic incident with a man who outweighs me by forty pounds and knows where the airport police aren't? I handed over the notes, he counted them with the speed of a casino dealer, and I dragged my broken suitcase through the sliding doors feeling like I'd just funded someone's very nice dinner.</p>\n    <h3>You Always Know and It Never Helps</h3>\n    <p>The thing about getting scammed by a taxi driver is that it's never a surprise. Nobody has ever climbed out of an overpriced cab and thought \"well I certainly didn't see that coming.\" You see it coming from the moment they don't turn the meter on. You see it when they take the weird left instead of getting on the motorway. You see it the whole time, like watching a slow-motion replay of your own mugging, and you sit there anyway because the alternative is worse.</p>\n    <p>Because that's the real scam. It's not the broken meter or the scenic route or the made-up price. It's the fact that they've correctly identified you as someone with somewhere to be. You've got a flight. You've got a check-in deadline. You've got a bag that weighs 23 kilos and no idea how the local bus system works. You are, in the most literal sense, a captive audience. And they know it the way a lion knows a limping gazelle.</p>\n    <h3>A Lesson I Will Learn Again Next Year</h3>\n    <p>I said I'd never do it again. I said I'd pre-book transfers, download <a href=\"https://maps.me/\">offline maps</a>, take the <a href=\"https://www.trenitalia.com/en/services/leonardo-express.html\">Leonardo Express</a> like a functioning adult. And I meant it, truly, right up until three months later when I was standing outside Naples Centrale at midnight with a dead phone and a ferry to catch in the morning.</p>\n    <p>The driver tapped his meter. Shrugged.</p>\n    <p>\"Is broken.\"</p>\n    <p>I got in anyway. Some languages don't need translation, and the conversation between a desperate tourist and an opportunistic cab driver is one of them. I buckled my seatbelt, watched him take a left where he should have gone right, and settled in for the ride. At least this time I knew what dinner was going to cost me.</p>\n    \n      <div class=\"score\">2.5<span>/10</span></div>\n      <div class=\"verdict\">Half a point for the nonna hanging laundry.

    "body": "<h3>The Forecast Said \"Head High.\" The Forecast Lied.</h3>\n    <p>I'd like to tell you I did my research. That I checked the swell charts, cross-referenced Surfline with Magic Seaweed, studied the wind patterns like a man possessed. And I did. All of it pointed to Bali in late March being a perfectly reasonable decision. Six-hour flight from Sydney, two weeks of annual leave burning a hole in my inbox, and a freshly purchased 250-buck board bag that I'd convinced myself was an investment. The ocean had other plans.</p>\n    <p>I landed in Denpasar at 11pm, sticky and optimistic. By 6am the next morning I was standing on the beach at low tide, looking at what can only be described as a swimming pool. Not one of those flash infinity pools that blends into the horizon. A municipal pool. The kind with a bandaid floating in it. Flat. Completely, insultingly flat.</p>\n    <h3>Welcome to the Waiting Room</h3>\n    <p>The surf camp I'd booked was full of blokes just like me. Twelve sunburnt idiots who'd all flown in from various corners of the world, clutching board bags and expectations, now sitting around a communal table eating nasi goreng at 9am because there was genuinely nothing else to do. The vibe was funeral. Imagine a support group, but instead of sharing feelings, everyone just kept refreshing Windguru on their phones and sighing.</p>\n    <p>And then there were the locals. The guys who'd been here long enough to have seen waves. They loved telling you about it too.</p>\n    <p>\"Bro, you should've been here last week. Padang was six foot and glassy. Best session of my life.\"</p>\n    <p>Cheers mate. Really helpful. I'll just pop into my time machine, shall I?</p>\n    <p>Every single person I met had some version of this story. Last week. Three days ago. Yesterday afternoon, even, though I'm fairly sure that one was a lie because I'd been staring at the ocean yesterday afternoon and the most exciting thing that happened was a plastic bag drifting past.</p>\n    <div class=\"pullquote\"><p>\"Bro, you should've been here last week.\" Cheers mate. I'll just pop into my time machine, shall I?</p></div>\n    <h3>Day Three and the Bintang Shirts Start Making Sense</h3>\n    <p>By day three I'd stopped waking up early to check the surf. What's the point? I knew what was out there. Lake Bali. The great Indonesian puddle. I started sleeping until nine, eating banana pancakes for breakfast, reading a book by the pool. I was becoming the exact type of tourist I'd always judged. Next I'd be buying a singlet with \"One More Bintang\" printed on it and haggling over a fake Rolex in Kuta.</p>\n    <p>The board bag sat in the corner of my room like an accusation. Brand new. Tags still half on. The board inside it hadn't touched salt water. I'd carried that thing through three airports and a taxi ride where the driver strapped it to the roof with what appeared to be a shoelace, and for what? It was a 1,400-buck surfboard-shaped paperweight.</p>\n    <h3>The Paddle of Shame</h3>\n    <p>Day five, I cracked. I couldn't sit there any longer. There was something out there that could generously be described as movement on the water's surface. Ankle high, maybe knee high if you were feeling extremely charitable and also happened to be kneeling. I paddled out anyway. Three of us did, actually. Nobody spoke. We all knew this was pathetic and we'd all silently agreed not to acknowledge it.</p>\n    <p>I caught a wave. I use that term loosely. It was more like the ocean gently nudged me shoreward, the way you'd guide a confused elderly person back to their seat. I stood up for about two seconds before the wave lost interest in its own existence and dissolved into nothing. I rode that thing for maybe four metres. On the beach, a dog watched me with what I can only describe as pity.</p>\n    <p>I paddled back out. Sat there for another forty minutes. Caught one more mushy little nothing-burger, then went in and ordered a Bintang at 10:30 in the morning because honestly, what else was there?</p>\n    <h3>Meanwhile, Back in Reality</h3>\n    <p>The real knife twist came from Instagram. My mate Davo, back home in Cronulla, posted a video of our local break absolutely pumping. Head high, offshore winds, not a cloud in the sky. Clean lines stacking up to the horizon. He captioned it \"Just another Tuesday\" with a shrug emoji, the smug bastard.</p>\n    <p>I did the maths in my head. Flight was 800 bucks return. Surf camp was 120 a night. Board bag, 250. New rashie I didn't need, 60. I was roughly two grand deep into a holiday where the most surfing I'd done was watching Point Break on my laptop in bed while eating room service spring rolls. I could've stayed home, surfed every day for free, and spent the two grand on literally anything else.</p>\n    <h3>The Flat Acceptance</h3>\n    <p>By day seven I'd made peace with it. Not gracefully. More like the way you accept a parking fine. You know it's happened, you know there's nothing you can do, and you're mostly just annoyed at yourself for not reading the sign properly. I spent the last day getting a massage, eating satay on the beach, watching the sunset over water so still it looked like someone had poured resin over the Indian Ocean.</p>\n    <p>Flying home, I looked down at the ocean from 30,000 feet. From up there, you could see the swell lines rolling in towards the coast. Beautiful, perfect swell lines. Arriving approximately six hours after my plane touched down in Sydney. I pressed my forehead against the window and laughed, because if you don't laugh you'll throw your board bag into the sea. Which would be easy, since the sea was basically a footpath.</p>\n    \n      <div class=\"score\">1<span>/10</span></div>\n      <div class=\"verdict\">One point for the nasi goreng.

    "excerpt": "Thought I was ready for Indonesian reef breaks. The ocean disagreed. My left leg looked like a dropped lasagna.",
    "body": "<h3>The Confidence Was the First Thing to Break</h3>\n    <p>I'd been surfing for about three years when I decided I was ready for Indonesian reef breaks. Three years of mushy beach breaks on the east coast, the odd decent day at a point break, and one trip to Bali where I rode whitewash at Kuta and called it progression. In my head I was intermediate-to-advanced. In reality I was a kook with a tan and a shortboard I had no business riding.</p>\n    <p>But I'd watched the clips. I'd studied the lineups on Google Earth like some kind of wave-hunting intelligence analyst. I knew the tides, the swell direction, the wind windows. What I didn't know, and what no YouTube video will ever properly communicate, is how shallow a shallow reef break actually is. We're talking shin-deep water over coral that looks like it was designed by someone who hates human skin.</p>\n    <h3>The Ocean Said No</h3>\n    <p>The first couple of waves I caught were fine. Small ones, inside ones, the kind the locals let you have because they're barely worth the effort. I was buzzing. Hooting at myself like a complete dropkick. Then I paddled for one that was a bit bigger, a bit steeper, a bit further outside than I had any right to be.</p>\n    <p>I made the drop. For about one and a half seconds I was the guy in the edit, rail buried, spray flying, living the dream. Then the bottom dropped out and I went with it. Face first, arms flailing, straight into the washing machine. Except this washing machine had a floor made of broken glass and razor blades, and it was about forty centimetres below the surface.</p>\n    <div class=\"pullquote\"><p>I came up and looked down at my leg and it looked like a dropped lasagna.</p></div>\n    <p>The reef grabbed me like it had a personal grudge. I felt it rake across my hip, my thigh, my knee, my shin, my ankle. Just one long continuous scrape from waist to foot, like someone had taken a cheese grater to my entire left side. I came up gasping and looked down at my leg and it looked like a dropped lasagna.</p>\n    <h3>The Paddle of Shame</h3>\n    <p>Here's the thing about getting destroyed at a spot where Indonesian locals have been surfing since before you were born. They've seen it. A thousand times. There's no sympathy coming your way. A couple of guys paddled past me on my way in and one of them gave me this look that was somewhere between amusement and mild pity, the way you'd look at a dog that just ran into a glass door.</p>\n    <p>I belly-rode the whitewater in because I couldn't stand on my board without my leg feeling like it was on fire. Every bump over a section of reef sent a fresh jolt through me. Blood was running down my ankle and mixing with the saltwater and honestly it looked far worse than it was. Or maybe it was exactly as bad as it looked. Hard to say when you're trying not to cry in front of a twelve-year-old local kid who just pulled into the barrel of the day.</p>\n    <h3>Betadine and Broken Pride</h3>\n    <p>I limped up the cliff path leaving a trail of watered-down blood on the limestone stairs like some kind of injured animal. Found my way to the nearest warung and sat down on a plastic chair and ordered a Bintang because priorities. The woman running the place took one look at my leg and disappeared out back, returning with a bottle of Betadine and a look that said she does this three times a week.</p>\n    <p>She dabbed the Betadine on without warning and I made a noise that I'm not proud of. Somewhere between a yelp and a whimper. A grown man, sitting in a warung at eleven in the morning, beer in one hand, making sounds like a wounded bird while a tiny Indonesian woman cleaned gravel out of his leg. I tipped her about 50,000 rupiah which is roughly five bucks and felt like it should have been more.</p>\n    <h3>The Bed Situation</h3>\n    <p>Nobody warns you about the sleeping part. You survive the reef, you survive the cleanup, you think the worst is over. It is not over. The worst part of reef rash is trying to sleep in a cheap guesthouse where the sheets have the thread count of sandpaper and the humidity is running at about nine hundred percent.</p>\n    <p>You lie on your good side. Fine for twenty minutes. Then you shift. The sheet peels off your wound like a wax strip and you're suddenly wide awake, staring at the ceiling fan, questioning every decision that led you to this bed in this room in this country. You try sleeping on your back. The sheet sticks again. You try sleeping with no sheet. The mosquitoes find you in under a minute. You try wrapping your leg in a sarong. It sticks worse than the sheet.</p>\n    <p>I spent three nights barely sleeping, peeling fabric off my leg every time I moved, applying Betadine in the dark like some kind of midnight nurse, and lying there listening to the geckos on the wall wondering if this is what surf magazines mean by \"the trip of a lifetime.\"</p>\n    <h3>Would I Do It Again</h3>\n    <p>I went back out two days later because I am not a smart man. Caught two waves on the inside, both tiny, both forgettable. Came in voluntarily before the reef could finish what it started. Sat in the warung with another Bintang and watched the guys who actually knew what they were doing thread through sections that would have sent me to a hospital in Denpasar.</p>\n    <p>I've still got a scar on my left shin that goes white when I get cold. My mates reckon it looks tough. I tell them it was bigger than it was, because that's what you do. But late at night, when I'm lying in a proper bed with proper sheets that don't stick to anything, I can still feel that reef under my skin, reminding me of the day the Indian Ocean looked me dead in the eye and said mate, you are not ready for this.</p>\n    \n      <div class=\"score\">2<span>/10</span></div>\n      <div class=\"verdict\">One point for the Betadine lady.

    "body": "<h3>The Board That Hope Built</h3>\n    <p>I've made some questionable decisions in my life but handing over 1,500 rupees for a surfboard held together with duct tape and what I can only assume was spiritual conviction ranks pretty high. The guy at the rental shack picked it up like he was presenting a newborn. \"Very strong board, brother. No problem.\" There was a crack running down the middle that you could fit a coin into. The nose had been reattached at some point using what looked like bathroom sealant. I took it anyway because the next nearest rental place was apparently \"just down the road\" which in Sri Lankan terms means somewhere between twenty minutes and next Tuesday.</p>\n    <h3>Two Waves and a Funeral</h3>\n    <p>I paddled out feeling optimistic, which should have been my first warning sign. The first wave was fine. A gentle little thing, barely worth standing up for, but I stood up anyway and felt briefly like a person who knew what they were doing. Wave number two was slightly bigger. Nothing scary. Maybe chest high on a short day. I popped up, started trimming along the face, heard a sound like someone snapping a cricket bat over their knee, and then I was underwater holding two separate pieces of surfboard.</p>\n    <p>I surfaced to find the rental guy already waving from the beach. Not waving with concern. Waving like he wanted to have a chat about payment for damages. Mate, the thing was already damaged when I got it. That's like buying a car with no engine and getting billed when it won't start.</p>\n    <div class=\"pullquote\"><p>He had this way of looking disappointed in me that reminded me of my dad and I just handed over the money.</p></div>\n    <p>We had a fifteen-minute negotiation that ended with me paying another 800 bucks for the privilege of having destroyed something that was already destroyed. I'm not proud of how quickly I caved but he had this way of looking disappointed in me that reminded me of my dad and I just handed over the money.</p>\n    <h3>Board Number Two, or \"The Finless Wonder\"</h3>\n    <p>Further down the beach there was another place renting boards. This one looked more legit. The boards were standing upright in a rack instead of lying in the sand next to a sleeping dog. Progress. I picked out a decent-looking 7'2 and carried it to the water before noticing something was off. Flipped it over. No fins. Not like the fins were broken. The fin boxes were there but completely empty, just three little rectangular holes staring up at me like the board was as surprised as I was.</p>\n    <p>I walked back. \"This one has no fins.\" The guy looked at it, looked at me, nodded slowly, and said \"Yes.\" That was it. Yes. Like I'd pointed out that the sky was blue. He didn't offer a solution or a different board. Just confirmed the observation and went back to his phone.</p>\n    <p>I tried two more boards from his rack. One had fins but was so waterlogged it weighed about as much as a small fridge. The other was a shortboard designed for someone who weighs sixty kilos and actually knows how to surf, so that ruled me out on both counts.</p>\n    <h3>The Great Equipment Hunt of Weligama</h3>\n    <p>What followed was an hour-long march through town asking everyone if they knew where I could rent a surfboard that functioned as a surfboard. A tuk-tuk driver offered to take me to his cousin's place. A woman at a grocery shop pointed vaguely toward the south. A bloke at a guesthouse said he had one I could borrow but when he brought it out it was a windsurf board from what appeared to be 1987, complete with a mast hole in the middle. I stared at it for a while. He stared at me staring at it. Neither of us said anything.</p>\n    <p>The heat was getting unbearable and I'd sweated through my rashie twice over. I sat on the seawall, drank a King Coconut that cost me 50 bucks, and watched the ocean mock me with perfect little peeling waves that were going completely unridden.</p>\n    <h3>Humbled by a Ten-Year-Old</h3>\n    <p>That's when I noticed the kid. Couldn't have been older than ten. Skinny little legend on a foam bodyboard, absolutely tearing the place apart. He was launching off sections, pulling into closeouts on purpose just for laughs, and paddling back out faster than I could on a good day with flippers. I watched him for a solid twenty minutes with a mixture of admiration and deep personal shame.</p>\n    <p>During a lull he paddled in and sat near me on the sand. We got talking. His English was way better than my Sinhala, which consists entirely of the word \"thank you\" pronounced badly. I told him I couldn't find a board. He looked at me with genuine pity, the kind of pity a surgeon gives you before delivering bad news, and said \"You can use mine.\"</p>\n    <p>So that's how I ended up bodyboarding in Sri Lanka. Thirty-one years old, lying on a bright yellow foam board that had SpongeBob on it, getting repeatedly pummelled by waves that this child had been styling on minutes earlier. Every time I caught one he'd cheer from the beach. Encouraging. Supportive. The way you cheer for a dog that finally learns to shake hands.</p>\n    <h3>Lessons from the Foam</h3>\n    <p>I gave the board back after an hour, bought the kid an ice cream that cost less than a single fin plug, and walked back to my guesthouse smelling like reef and failure. My shoulders were sunburned in the shape of the rashie I'd taken off because it was too hot, which meant I looked like a human neapolitan ice cream for the rest of the week.</p>\n    <p>Somewhere in that town there are still surfboards with no fins and surfboards held together with tape and surfboards that are technically windsurfers. And somewhere on that beach there's a ten-year-old kid on a SpongeBob bodyboard who surfs better than I ever will. I think about him sometimes, usually when I'm buying expensive gear I don't deserve, and I reckon he's still out there, ripping, not needing any of it.</p>\n    \n      <div class=\"score\">3<span>/10</span></div>\n      <div class=\"verdict\">Three points.
